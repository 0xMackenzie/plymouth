- fix the tests so that they work better with "make check"
- Allow plymouth to be started from nash instead of the other way around
- Drop all the make ram disk and copy code.  That was just to make bolting things on easier.  We can integrate now.
- allow longer than 255 byte replies from server to client
- make server send immediate ACK for password request and then ANSWER later with a link back to original request in ANSWER
- Add limited text support
- Make --ask-for-password take a prompt message
- consider making details plugin have stdin hooked up to the pty instead of tty so input works
- consider making details plugin go back to pretty plugin if user presses escape
- add expose handler for plugins to draw from.  We need to reset some state every frame of the animation, so better to hide that.
- clean up /var/run/plymouth before nash switchroots
