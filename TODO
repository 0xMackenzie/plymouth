- fix the tests so that they work better with "make check"
- watch init as it progresses through boot up.  This might mean:
  - adding the ability to monitor files for changes
  - watching /var/run/utmp
  - reading out the relevant INIT_PROCESS entry when /var/run/utmp changes
- move most of the code to a separate runtime library (libplyre maybe?) and
  have the various binaries link to it
