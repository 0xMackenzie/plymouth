- fix the tests so that they work better with "make check"
- Don't start boot-splash automatically, rather wait until given command from client
- Allow plymouth to be started from nash instead of the other way around
- Drop all the make ram disk and copy code.  That was just to make bolting things on easier.  We can integrate now.
- check peer credentials on client to make sure it's not running unprivileged
