.SH NAME
plymouth \- A graphical boot system and logger
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B plymouth-set-default-theme
.RI [ options ] " \<theme\>"
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBplymouth\fP is a a graphical boot system for Linux which takes advantage of the kernel-based
mode setting (KMS) available for modern graphic cards to provide a seamless, flickerfree
and attractive boot screen. It supercedes the Red Hat graphical boot manager (RHGB) on Fedora
and Red Hat systems and replaces usplash with xplash on Ubuntu and Debian. It allows
to choose between various, static or animated graphical themes to spruce up the
startup and avoid the noise generated by the vast amount of kernel messages while
the machine boots into X. On systems where kernel-based mode setting is not available,
plymouth falls back to a text mode boot screen which provides a simple progress bar
to provide feedback during boot.
.PP
To configure plymouth, that is to choose and install the preferred boot theme, the
user has to invoke \fBplymouth-set-default-theme\fP. It changes the configuration
to the new theme and also performs the necessary regeneration of the initial ramdisk
(initrd) since plymouth is loaded from the boot loader from the initrd
prior to the mounting of the root filesystem. The options available to this
script are explained in the \fBOPTIONS\fP paragraph.
.PP
In order for plymouth to be loaded during boot, the option `rhgb' must be provided
at the kernel command line. Depending on your version of GRUB (1 or 2), this
involves editing the files menu.lst or grub.cfg in your default grub directory
or editing a special grub configuration file in /etc, followed by invoking
something like `update-grub'.
.SH OPTIONS
plymouth-set-default-theme follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-') and short variants of each of them.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
\" .B \-v, \-\-version
\" Show version of program.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-list
List available themes.
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-reset
Reset to default theme.
.TP
.B \-R, \-\-rebuild\-initrd
Rebuild initrd (necessary after changing theme).
.TP
.B \<theme-name\>
Name of new theme to use. If you want to see which themes are available, invoke the script with just \-\-list.
.PP
If plymouth-set-default-theme is invoked with no options or parameters, it shows the currently selected theme
by default. This output is used by the helper scripts `plymouth-generate-initrd' and `plymouth-update-initrd'
to set the proper theme in the initial ramdisk.
